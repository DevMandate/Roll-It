## 🎲 Roll It Game

Welcome to the **Roll It Game**, a turn-based dice game where players race to reach a score of 100. This game is built around strategic risk-taking — roll the dice and try your luck, but beware of the number 1!

## 🧩 Game Flow

The game flow is as follows:

### 🎯 Objective

Be the first player to reach a total score of **100 points**.


## 🔁 Game Rules

1. **User Rolls the Dice**

   * A random dice roll is generated and displayed.
   * If the roll is **not 1**, it's added to the **current score**.
   * If the roll **is 1**, the current score is lost and the turn switches to the next player.

2. **User Holds the Score**

   * Adds the current score to the **total score**.
   * If the total score is **100 or more**, the current player wins.
   * If not, the turn switches to the next player.

3. **User Resets the Game**

   * All scores (current and total) are reset to 0.
   * Player 1 starts the new game.


## 🧠 Strategy Tips

* Roll wisely — getting a 1 ends your turn with **zero gain**.
* Use the **Hold** button when you've accumulated a decent current score and want to **bank** it.
* Think ahead — sometimes playing it safe is the best move.
